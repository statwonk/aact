3389|NCT00289744|Year 10 Long-term Follow-up|All subjects enrolled in the primary study (208127/076) were invited to come back for the long-term follow-up visits at Year 6 to 10. The enrollment in the protocol section reflects the amount of subjects who came back at year 10. At earlier timepoints more subjects came back and therefore this number is greater than in the protocol section.|25 subjects lost seroprotective concentrations for anti-HBs antibodies at blood sampling time-points Years 6 to 10 and were offered an additional dose of Engerix™-B after Year 10 (additional dose phase). These subjects are presented in separate sub-groups for analysis purposes while as per study protocol, the single experimental group is Twinrix.

3392|NCT00289770|Year 11||Subjects who came back at a follow-up, did not necessarily come back at an earlier timepoint.
